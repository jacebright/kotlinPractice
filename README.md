# Overview

This project is a simple recipe finder that I developed to delve into the basics of the Kotlin language. This recipe finder reads a given file that contains a list of recipes and allows a user to filter them
by category (ie. Breakfast, Asian, Dessert). 

My purpose in writing this software was to begin an understanding of the Kotlin language and prepare to understand Android App development through the lense of this crucial language.

# Development Environment

For developing this project, I utilized the Inteli-J IDE. This IDE was well suited to create the necessary file structure and run the program.

I utilized the File library from Java in order to read the necessary external CSV file.
